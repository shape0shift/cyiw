CYIW (Calculate Your Index Well) is a set of Python programs to calculate different reading ease indices. 

CYIW is a constant work in progress, for now there are programs for Russian, Ukrainian, Polish, and German. Out of these, the Russian one is the most tested, and it should work well. The interface is in German for the time being.
